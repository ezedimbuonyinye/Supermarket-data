##Project Overview
This project analyzes a Supermarketâ€™s historical Sales data to uncover insights about *profitability, customer behavior, regional performance, and product trends*. It uses real-world datasets (Orders, Returns, Users) to answer key business questions and provide actionable recommendations.
The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills from data cleaning to exploration down to visualization, and storytelling then to business recommendations.
The dataset consists of three sheets:
* Orders â†’ Sales transactions (customers, products, sales, profit, shipping, discounts).
* Returns â†’ Returned orders impacting revenue and profit.
* Users â†’ Regional managers responsible for performance.
*Discounts & Profitability*
 * Higher discounts correlate with *negative profit* (especially in Technology & Furniture).
   * Recommendation: Introduce a *discount cap* to prevent profit erosion.

2. *Customer Segments*

   * *Corporate customers* drive bulk sales but lower margins.
   * *Home Office customers* show higher profitability per unit.
   * Recommendation: Create a *loyalty program* for Home Office segment.

3. *Regional Performance*

   * Central region (Chris) has the most consistent profitability.
   * East & West suffer from *higher return rates*, hurting profit.
   * Recommendation: Share Centralâ€™s best practices across regions.

4. *Product Categories*

   * *Technology* â†’ High sales, inconsistent profit due to returns.
   * *Office Supplies* â†’ High volume, low margins.
   * *Furniture* â†’ Shipping costs reduce profitability.
* Recommendation: Improve *Furniture logistics* and *Technology after-sales support*.
