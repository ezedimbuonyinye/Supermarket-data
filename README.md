##Project Overview
This project analyzes a Supermarket’s historical Sales data to uncover insights about *profitability, customer behavior, regional performance, and product trends*. It uses real-world datasets (Orders, Returns, Users) to answer key business questions and provide actionable recommendations.
The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills from data cleaning to exploration down to visualization, and storytelling then to business recommendations.
The dataset consists of three sheets:
* Orders → Sales transactions (customers, products, sales, profit, shipping, discounts).
* Returns → Returned orders impacting revenue and profit.
* Users → Regional managers responsible for performance.
